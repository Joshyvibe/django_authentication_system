# Django Authentication Project

Welcome to the Django Authentication Project repository! This project provides a robust and secure user authentication system for your Django web applications. With this system, you can easily manage user accounts, handle user registration and login, and implement role-based permissions.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allow users to create accounts with email verification.
- **User Login**: Secure authentication with hashed passwords.
- **User Profiles**: Customize user profiles with additional information.
- **Role-Based Access**: Assign roles to users for permission control.
- **Password Reset**: Enable users to reset forgotten passwords.
- **Social Authentication**: Implement OAuth login with popular social media platforms.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage user accounts and permissions through the Django admin interface.

   ```

3. Apply database migrations:
